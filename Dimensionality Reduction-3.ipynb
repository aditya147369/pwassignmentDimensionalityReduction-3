    "Ans - Eigen-decomposition, a cornerstone of linear algebra, provides a powerful lens to analyze the behavior of linear transformations represented by square matrices.

In essence, they represent the \"fixed points\" or \"invariant directions\" of the transformation. Eigenvalues, on the other hand, are scalar values associated with each eigenvector, quantifying the scaling factor applied to the eigenvector during the transformation.

It involves constructing a similarity or affinity matrix and computing its eigenvectors. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues can be used to partition the data into clusters. Spectral clustering is particularly useful for handling non-linearly separable data and discovering complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): LSA is a technique used in natural language processing to analyze and extract the semantic structure from a collection of documents. It employs Eigen-Decomposition on a term-document matrix to identify latent topics or concepts in the documents. The eigenvectors obtained from the decomposition represent the underlying semantic structure of the documents, and they can be used to perform tasks such as document similarity, document classification, and information retrieval.\n",
